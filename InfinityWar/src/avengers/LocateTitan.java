/**
 * 
 * Using the Adjacency Matrix of n vertices and starting from Earth (vertex 0), 
 * modify the edge weights using the functionality values of the vertices that each edge 
 * connects, and then determine the minimum cost to reach Titan (vertex n-1) from Earth (vertex 0).
 * 
 * Steps to implement this class main method:
 * 
 * Step 1:
 * LocateTitanInputFile name is passed through the command line as args[0]
 * Read from LocateTitanInputFile with the format:
 *    1. g (int): number of generators (vertices in the graph)
 *    2. g lines, each with 2 values, (int) generator number, (double) funcionality value
 *    3. g lines, each with g (int) edge values, referring to the energy cost to travel from 
 *       one generator to another 
 * Create an adjacency matrix for g generators.
 * 
 * Populate the adjacency matrix with edge values (the energy cost to travel from one 
 * generator to another).
 * 
 * Step 2:
 * Update the adjacency matrix to change EVERY edge weight (energy cost) by DIVIDING it 
 * by the functionality of BOTH vertices (generators) that the edge points to. Then, 
 * typecast this number to an integer (this is done to avoid precision errors). The result 
 * is an adjacency matrix representing the TOTAL COSTS to travel from one generator to another.
 * 
 * Step 3:
 * LocateTitanOutputFile name is passed through the command line as args[1]
 * Use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the path of minimum cost between Earth and Titan. 
 * Output this number into your output file!
 * 
 * Note: use the StdIn/StdOut libraries to read/write from/to file.
 * 
 *   To read from a file use StdIn:
 *     StdIn.setFile(inputfilename);
 *     StdIn.readInt();
 *     StdIn.readDouble();
 * 
 *   To write to a file use StdOut (here, minCost represents the minimum cost to 
 *   travel from Earth to Titan):
 *     StdOut.setFile(outputfilename);
 *     StdOut.print(minCost);
 *  
 * Compiling and executing:
 *    1. Make sure you are in the ../InfinityWar directory
 *    2. javac -d bin src/avengers/*.java
 *    3. java -cp bin avengers/LocateTitan locatetitan.in locatetitan.out
